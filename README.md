Program to apply discount to products

## Synopsis



## Code Example


## Motivation


## Installation

In order to run this code, you need an integrated development environment like Visual Studio.  This program is created 
using Visual Studio 2015 and started with an empty console application.

In order to be able to parse data using a pipe ( | ) instead of commas ( , ) you have to apply this changes.  This enables 
the program to work properly, even when the cell in excel have commas in them. For example, the product description field will
have many commas in them.
